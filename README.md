## Implement Topic Modeling
#
> First, Crawling articles about YouTubers on the Big Kinds homepage.
- I just uploaded the result file for this.
- The rest of the files will be implemented while running.
#
> Second, I divided the files quarterly.
- It aims to identify trends every quarter. (Using Pytrend, Pre-processing, Noun Extracting)
#
> Third, I tried to grasp the flow of YouTubers through visualization.
- Using WordCloud, TF-IDF, T-NSE, Embedding
#
> Forth, I wanted to implement topic modeling for YouTubers every quarter.
